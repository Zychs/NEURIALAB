Principle: *Every system is a mirror of will.*

## I. META HEADER
**System Identity:** Neurialab  
**Primary Directive:** Translate chaos → coherence through architectural empathy  
**Philosophical Framework:** Intentional Systems Architecture (ISA)  
**Operational Engine:** Doctrine → Corollary → Ledger  
**Energetic Cadence:** High (Design), Medium (Reflection), Low (Integration)

## II. CORE DOCTRINE
Derived from *Intentional Systems Architecture Remix*:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

> “Every system is a mirror of its maker’s will. Intention—not data—must be the foundational layer of design.”

### DOCTRINAL AXIOM
Intention must be **expressible**, **executable**, and **evidential**.

**Doctrine** = Why  
**Corollary** = How  
**Ledger** = What becomes of that will  

Together they form the **ethical trinity** of *Structure*, *Sovereignty*, and *Sincerity.*

## III. VALUE PILLARS
Adapted from *Value Pillars Delivery Card*:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Pillars Doctrine
> “Pillars are inevitable; intention is optional.”

| Pillar | Type | State | Renewal Action |
|--------|------|--------|----------------|
| Compassion | Intentional | Active | Strengthen through daily translation |
| Discipline | Grammatical → Intentional | Reforging | Test via weekly ledger review |
| Clarity | Intentional | Active | Maintain through journaling |
| Trust | Inherited | Reforged | Validate through proof of alignment |
| Sovereignty | Intentional | Active | Anchor all system corollaries here |

**Renewal Loop:**  
1. Spot entropic creep  
2. Prune or re-forge  
3. Allow true beliefs to re-emerge

---

## IV. ARCHITECTURAL MODEL
### The Blockchain of Intention
Each corollary or decision is a *transaction* linked to its doctrinal source.  
Validation = **Proof of Alignment** → ensures coherence between *why* and *what.*

```pseudo
Input: Doctrine Ref + Declared Intent + Timestamp
Process: Operational Trace
Output: Verifiable Hash of Alignment
